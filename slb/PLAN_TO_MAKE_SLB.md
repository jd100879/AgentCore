## Executive Summary

**slb** is a cross-platform CLI tool implementing a "two-person rule" (inspired by nuclear launch protocols) for potentially destructive commands executed by AI coding agents. When an agent wants to run a dangerous command (e.g., `rm -rf`, `kubectl delete node`, `DROP DATABASE`), it must submit the command for peer review by another agent. Only when a second agent independently evaluates the reasoning and approves does the command execute.

**Core insight**: AI agents can hallucinate, get tunnel vision, or misunderstand context. A fresh perspective from a second agent—especially one with different training/architecture—catches errors before they become irreversible disasters.

**Primary use case**: Multiple Claude Code / Codex / other AI agents working in parallel on the same codebase, where one agent's mistake could destroy another's work or critical infrastructure.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Scenario

You're running 30 terminal windows with AI agents working in parallel. Agent #17 decides it needs to clean up some files and runs `rm -rf /important-data`. Or it "helpfully" deletes your Kubernetes nodes because it misunderstood the task.

### Why This Happens

1. **Tunnel vision**: Agents focus on their immediate task and lose sight of broader context
2. **Hallucination**: Agents confidently execute commands based on incorrect assumptions
3. **Missing context**: Agent doesn't know what other agents are doing
4. **Overconfidence**: Agent believes a destructive action is "obviously correct"
5. **Ambiguous instructions**: Human's intent was misinterpreted

### The Solution

Before executing any command matching "dangerous" patterns, agents must:
1. Submit the command with detailed justification
2. Wait for independent review by another agent
3. Only proceed after explicit approval

This creates a **deliberate friction point** that forces reconsideration of destructive actions.

---

## Critical Design Feedback

### Issues with Original Proposal

#### 1. Single Lock File is Problematic

**Original idea**: Create `.slb_command_lock_file` in the project folder.

**Problems**:
- Multiple pending commands would overwrite each other
- Race conditions between agents
- Git noise if not properly ignored
- No support for queued commands

**Better approach**:
```
.slb/
  pending/
    req-a1b2c3d4.json    # Each request gets unique file
    req-e5f6g7h8.json
  processed/
    2025-12-13/
      req-x9y0z1.json    # Archived after resolution
  sessions/
    agent-GreenLake.json # Active agent registrations
  config.toml            # Project-level configuration
```

#### 2. Polling Loop is Wasteful

**Original idea**: "slb is running in a loop the entire time in the background (using very low resources)"

**Problem**: Polling loops waste CPU cycles and battery, even when "low resource."

**Better approach**:
- Use native file system watchers (inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows)
- Go's fsnotify provides cross-platform file watching
- Only wake up when files actually change
- Alternatively: Unix domain socket for immediate IPC between agents and daemon

#### 3. "Different Model" Requirement is Hard to Enforce

**Original idea**: Optionally require approver to be different model (e.g., Claude can't approve Claude).

**Problem**: Self-reported model info has no cryptographic verification.

**Solution**:
- Accept this as advisory/honor-system rather than security guarantee
- Log model info for audit purposes
- The real value is the second perspective, not the model difference
- Optional strict mode where human must approve if same-model

#### 4. What Counts as "Dangerous"?

**Missing**: Clear definition of which commands need review.

**Solution**: Tiered pattern matching system (detailed below)

---

## My Creative Additions

### 1. Pre-flight Dry Run

For commands that support it, automatically run a dry-run version:

```bash
# Original command:
kubectl delete deployment my-app

# slb automatically runs:
kubectl delete deployment my-app --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

The dry-run output is attached to the request, giving reviewers concrete information about what WILL happen, not just what the requestor CLAIMS will happen.

**Supported commands**:
- `kubectl *` → `--dry-run=client`
- `terraform destroy` → `terraform plan -destroy`
- `rm` → show file listing of what would be deleted
- `git reset --hard` → `git diff HEAD..<target>`

### 2. Three-Tier Risk Classification

Not all dangerous commands are equally dangerous:

| Tier | Risk Level | Default Behavior | Examples |
|------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Catastrophic, irreversible | 2+ approvals required, human notification | `rm -rf /`, `DROP DATABASE`, `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete node` |
| **DANGEROUS** | Significant, recoverable with effort | 1 approval required | `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf <dir>`, `kubectl delete deployment` |
| **CAUTION** | Annoying if wrong, easily fixed | Auto-approved after 30s with logging | `rm *.log`, `git clean`, `npm uninstall` |

Users configure patterns into tiers. Sensible defaults provided.

### 3. Rollback Capture

Before executing CRITICAL/DANGEROUS commands, optionally capture state:

```bash
# Before: kubectl delete deployment my-app
# slb captures: kubectl get deployment my-app -o yaml > .slb/rollback/req-xxx/my-app.yaml

# Before: rm -rf ./data/
# slb captures: tar -czf .slb/rollback/req-xxx/data-backup.tar.gz ./data/
```

Enables one-command rollback from TUI if things go wrong.

### 4. Context Attachments

Requesting agent can attach supporting evidence:

```json
{
  "attachments": [
    {
      "type": "file_snippet",
      "path": "src/db/migrations/drop-users.sql",
      "lines": "1-15"
    },
    {
      "type": "conversation_excerpt",
      "content": "User said: 'Please remove the old users table'"
    },
    {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123"
    }
  ]
}
```

Reviewer sees full context, not just the command and a text explanation.

### 5. Agent Mail Integration

Since MCP Agent Mail already exists in this ecosystem, integrate:

- When request created → send agent mail to "SLB-Reviews" thread
- Reviewers can check their inbox for pending reviews
- Approval/rejection can flow through agent mail
- Creates unified coordination channel

### 6. Desktop Notifications

For CRITICAL tier commands:
- macOS: `osascript` notification
- Linux: `notify-send`
- Windows: PowerShell toast

Human gets alerted even if not watching terminals.

### 7. Learning Mode / Analytics

Track historical patterns:
- Which commands get approved vs rejected
- Which approved commands caused subsequent problems
- Which agents have high rejection rates
- Time-to-approval metrics

Surface insights in TUI dashboard. Over time, can suggest pattern refinements.

### 8. Emergency Override

Human can bypass the system when needed:

```bash
slb emergency-execute "rm -rf /tmp/stuck-process"
```

Logs extensively, requires explicit acknowledgment, but doesn't block on agent approval.

### 9. Command Templates (Allowlists)

Pre-approved command patterns that skip review:

```toml
[templates.safe]
# These patterns never need review
patterns = [
  "rm *.log",
  "rm *.tmp",
  "kubectl delete pod",      # Pods are ephemeral
  "git stash",
  "npm cache clean",
]
```

### 10. Conflict Resolution

When reviewers disagree (one approves, one rejects):

- Default: **Any rejection blocks** (safety priority)
- Configurable: First response wins (speed priority)
- Configurable: Require **N approvals** with **0 rejections**
- Configurable: Human breaks ties (explicit escalation path)
- Always: Log the disagreement for audit

## Technical Architecture

### Language & Runtime

**Primary**: Go 1.25 with Charmbracelet ecosystem

**Rationale** (matching NTM's proven architecture):
- **Bubble Tea** (bubbletea): Elm-architecture TUI framework with excellent composability
- **Bubbles**: Pre-built components (textinput, list, viewport, spinner, progress, etc.)
- **Lip Gloss**: CSS-like terminal styling with gradients, borders, padding
- **Glamour**: Markdown rendering for rich help text and request details
- **Cobra**: Industry-standard CLI framework with excellent completion support
- **fsnotify**: Cross-platform file system watching (inotify/FSEvents/etc.)
- **TOML** (BurntSushi/toml): Human-friendly configuration
- Compiles to single static binary - no runtime dependencies
- Excellent cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- NTM proves this stack produces beautiful, performant TUIs

### Storage Model (Single Source of Truth)

To avoid "split brain" between JSON files and SQLite, slb has a clear data ownership model:

- **Authoritative state** for a project lives in **`.slb/state.db`** (SQLite, WAL mode)
  - Requests, reviews, sessions, pattern changes, and execution outcomes are written here
  - This is the coordination source of truth for all agents
- **`.slb/pending/` and `.slb/processed/` are materialized JSON snapshots**, generated from the DB:
  - They exist for **file watching**, **human inspection**, and **interop** (agents that prefer files)
  - They are **rebuildable**; deleting them does not lose history
  - Regenerated on every state change (write-through cache)
- **User-level `~/.slb/` stores are optional replicas** (cross-project search, personal audit)
  - Written by the daemon as a "replica," not as the coordination source of truth
  - Used for analytics, cross-project queries, and personal audit trails

### State Directories

**Project-level** (`.slb/` in project root):
```
.slb/
├── state.db                    # Authoritative SQLite DB for THIS project (WAL mode)
├── logs/                       # Execution output logs (not in DB)
│   └── req-<uuid>.log
├── pending/                    # Materialized JSON snapshots (rebuildable from DB)
│   └── req-<uuid>.json
├── sessions/                   # Active agent sessions (materialized)
│   └── <agent-name>.json
├── rollback/                   # Captured state for rollback
│   └── req-<uuid>/
│       └── <captured-files>

│   └── <date>/
│       └── req-<uuid>.json
└── config.toml                 # Project-specific config overrides
```

**User-level** (`~/.slb/`) — Optional replicas for cross-project features:
```
~/.slb/
├── config.toml                 # User configuration
├── history.db                  # Optional: cross-project index/analytics (replica)
├── history_git/                # Optional: personal audit trail git repo (replica)

## CLI Commands

### Core Commands

```bash
# Initialize slb in a project
slb init [--force]
  Creates .slb/ directory structure
  Adds .slb to .gitignore
  Generates project config.toml

# Version info
slb version [--json]
  Shows version, build info, config paths

# Daemon management
slb daemon start [--foreground]
slb daemon stop
slb daemon status
slb daemon logs [--follow] [--lines N]

# Session management (for agents)
slb session start --agent <name> --program <prog> --model <model>
  Returns: session ID and key
  Alias: -a for --agent, -p for --program, -m for --model

slb session end [--session-id <id>]
  Alias: -s for --session-id (used globally for all commands)

slb session resume --agent <name> [--program <prog>]
  Returns: existing active session if found, otherwise creates new
  Useful when agent restarts and wants to maintain session continuity
  Matches on agent name + program + project path

slb session list [--project <path>] [--json]
slb session heartbeat --session-id <id>
slb session reset-limits --session-id <id>   # Human can reset rate limits
```

**Global flag aliases** (apply to all commands):
- `-s` → `--session-id`
- `-j` → `--json`
- `-C` → `--project` (matches git's `-C <path>` convention; `-p` reserved for `--program`)

### JSON Output Contract (Stable API)

The CLI is agent-first, so `--json` output is treated as a **stable API contract**:

- **All JSON keys are `snake_case`** (no mixed `camelCase`)
- **Timestamps are RFC3339 UTC** (e.g., `2025-12-13T14:32:05Z`)
- Human-friendly formatting goes to **stderr**, machine JSON goes to **stdout**
- Commands that return lists return a **JSON array**
- Commands that stream (e.g., `watch`) output **NDJSON** (one JSON object per line) with `--json`

### Atomic Execution (Primary Agent Command)

```bash
# "Do it safely" — Checks, Requests, Waits, and Executes in one blocking call.
# THIS IS THE PRIMARY COMMAND AGENTS SHOULD USE.
slb run "<command>" \
  --reason "Why I need to run this" \
  [--expected-effect "What will happen"] \
  [--goal "What I'm trying to achieve"] \
  [--safety "Why this is safe/reversible"] \
  [--justification "Combined explanation (alternative to 4 separate fields)"] \
  [--session-id <id>] \
  [--timeout <seconds>]           # Approval wait timeout (default: 300)
  [--yield]                       # Allow this agent to review others while waiting (prevents deadlock)

  Behavior:
  1. Checks patterns. If SAFE: Executes immediately (pass-through).
  2. If DANGEROUS/CRITICAL:
     - Creates request automatically
     - Blocks process (streaming status to stderr)
     - If Approved: Executes immediately IN CALLER'S SHELL ENVIRONMENT
     - If Rejected/Timeout: Exits with code 1 and JSON error
  3. Command runs in the CALLING process's environment (inherits PATH, AWS_*, KUBECONFIG, etc.)

  Returns: { "status": "executed"|"rejected"|"timeout", "exit_code": N, ... }
```

### Request Commands (Plumbing - for manual/advanced workflows)

```bash
# Submit a command for approval (use `slb run` instead for most cases)
slb request "<command>" \
  --reason "Why I need to run this" \
  --expected-effect "What will happen" \
  --goal "What I'm trying to achieve" \
  --safety "Why this is safe/reversible" \
  [--justification "Combined explanation (alternative to 4 separate fields)"] \
  [--meta-file request.json]      # Pass rich metadata via file (avoids quoting hell)
  [--from-stdin]                  # Or pipe JSON into stdin
  [--attach-file <path>:<lines>] \
  [--attach-context "<text>"] \
  [--redact '<pattern>']          # Redact sensitive data in logs/display
  [--session-id <id>] \
  [--wait]                        # Block until approved/rejected
  [--execute]                     # If approved, execute immediately
  [--timeout <seconds>]

  Returns: request ID (or execution result with --wait --execute)

# Check request status
slb status <request-id>
  Returns: current status, reviews, etc.

# List pending requests
slb pending [--project <path>] [--all-projects] [--review-pool]
  Returns: list of pending requests
  --all-projects: Show from all projects (requires cross_project_reviews config)
  --review-pool: Show from configured review pool projects only

# Cancel own request
slb cancel <request-id> --session-id <id>
```

### Review Commands

```bash
# Review a pending request (full details)
slb review <request-id>
  Shows: command, justification, dry-run output, attachments

# Review multiple requests at once
slb review <id1> <id2> <id3> --json
  Returns: array of request details

# Approve a request
slb approve <request-id> \
  --session-id <id> \
  [--reason-response "..."] \
  [--effect-response "..."] \
  [--goal-response "..."] \
  [--safety-response "..."] \
  [--comment "Additional notes"]

# Bulk approve multiple requests
slb approve <id1> <id2> <id3> \
  --session-id <id> \
  [--reason-response "Batch approval: verified all are build cleanup"]
  # Bulk operations require all requests to be same tier (safety check)
  # Use --force-mixed-tiers to override

# Reject a request
slb reject <request-id> \
  --session-id <id> \
  --reason "Why this should not run" \
  [--reason-response "..."] \
  [--effect-response "..."] \
  [--goal-response "..."] \
  [--safety-response "..."]
```

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Execute an approved request
slb execute <request-id> [--session-id <id>] \
  [--timeout <seconds>]           # Kill command after timeout (default: 300)
  [--background]                  # Don't wait for completion, return PID

  Execution gate conditions (enforced by slb execute):
  1. Request status is APPROVED
  2. approval_expires_at has not elapsed (default: 30 min from approval)
  3. command_hash still matches (no mutation since approval)
  4. Current pattern policy does not raise the required tier/approvals
  5. First successful executor wins (idempotent)

  IMPORTANT: Command runs in the CALLING process's environment:
  - Inherits current shell env (AWS_*, PATH, KUBECONFIG, SSH_AUTH_SOCK, etc.)
  - Inherits current TTY (if interactive)
  - Streams stdout/stderr to terminal AND logs to file
  - Reports exit code back to DB to close request

  Returns: { "exit_code": N, "stdout": "...", "stderr": "...", "duration_ms": N }

# Emergency execute (human override, bypasses approval)
slb emergency-execute "<command>" \
  --reason "Why this can't wait" \
  [--capture-rollback] \
  [--yes]                         # Skip interactive confirmation
  [--ack "<sha256(command)>"]     # Required with --yes (binds to exact command)

  Requires: interactive confirmation OR --yes --ack flags
  Logs: extensively for audit (reason, cwd, argv, stdout/stderr)
```

### History & Search

```bash
# Search history
slb history \
  [--query "<fts query>"] \
  [--status <status>] \
  [--project <path>] \
  [--agent <name>] \
  [--since <date>] \
  [--until <date>] \
  [--limit N] \
  [--json]

# View specific historical request
slb show <request-id> [--json]

# Rollback an executed command
slb rollback <request-id>
  Requires: rollback data was captured
```

### Configuration

```bash
# View/edit configuration
slb config [--global | --project]
slb config get <key>
slb config set <key> <value>
slb config edit             # Opens in $EDITOR

# Pattern management
slb patterns list [--tier <tier>] [-j]
slb patterns test "<command>"    # Shows which tier it matches
  Alias: slb check "<command>"   # Shorter version for agents
  --exit-code                    # Return non-zero if approval needed (for hooks)

# Adding patterns (agents CAN do this freely)
slb patterns add --tier <tier> "<pattern>" [--reason "why this is dangerous"]
  Agents can add patterns to protect against mistakes they've seen
  Added patterns are logged with agent name and reason
  Example: slb patterns add --tier critical "^kubectl drain" --reason "Can evict all pods"

# Removing patterns (requires human approval!)
slb patterns remove "<pattern>"
  BLOCKED for agents - prints message to use TUI or get human approval
  Returns exit code 1 with JSON: {"error": "pattern_removal_requires_human", "use": "slb tui"}

slb patterns request-removal "<pattern>" --reason "why this should be safe"
  Agents can REQUEST removal, creates a pending removal request
  Human reviews in TUI and approves/rejects
  Removal requests shown in TUI dashboard alongside command requests

# Pattern suggestions (for agents to propose new patterns)
slb patterns suggest --tier <tier> "<pattern>" --reason "..."
  Like add, but marks as "suggested" for human review
  Human can promote to permanent or dismiss
```

### Watch Mode (for reviewing agents)

```bash
# Watch for pending requests and emit events for agents (non-interactive)
slb watch \
  [--project <path>] \
  [--session-id <id>] \
  [--auto-approve-caution]    # Auto-approve CAUTION tier
  [--json]                    # NDJSON stream: one event per line

  # Example NDJSON event:
  # {"event":"request_pending","request_id":"req-...","risk_tier":"dangerous","created_at":"..."}

  # Interactive approve/reject UX is exclusively in `slb tui`
```

### TUI Dashboard (Human-Only Interface)

```bash
# Launch full TUI dashboard - the ONLY interactive/human interface
slb tui
slb dashboard                 # Alias
```

### Base Command: Quick Reference Card

The entire CLI is designed for agent (robot) usage. Running `slb` with no arguments prints a colorful quick reference card using lipgloss styling:

```go
// internal/cli/root.go - when no subcommand provided
func printQuickRef() {
    // Colors (Catppuccin Mocha)

**Implementation notes**:
- Box drawing uses lipgloss borders with rounded corners
- Title uses gradient text effect (mauve → blue)
- Commands are syntax-highlighted (green for commands, yellow for flags)
- Tier badges are colored: 🔴 red, 🟠 orange, 🟡 yellow
- Responsive: adjusts to terminal width (min 72 cols, max 100)
- Falls back to ASCII on terminals without Unicode support

**Design Philosophy**:
- Every command is CLI-first, non-interactive
- All commands support `--json` for structured output
- No separate "robot mode" - the CLI IS the robot interface
- TUI dashboard (`slb tui`) is the only human-facing interface
- Agents should never need to parse human-formatted output

│    running on it have already been evicted. The cloud provider will not be     │
│    notified (no --cascade).                                                     │

### Visual Design Principles

1. **Information density**: Show key info at a glance, details on demand
2. **Color coding** (consistent across TUI, CLI output, notifications):
   - 🔴 Red: CRITICAL risk, rejected requests
   - 🟠 Orange: DANGEROUS risk, pending
   - 🟡 Yellow: CAUTION risk, auto-approved
   - 🟢 Green: approved, executed, SAFE tier
   - 🔵 Blue: informational, metadata
3. **Keyboard-first**: All actions have single-key shortcuts
4. **Responsive**: Adapts to terminal width (80 col minimum, scales to ultrawide)
5. **Real-time updates**: Dashboard refreshes as state changes
6. **Mouse support**: Optional, keyboard always works

---

## Configuration System

### Configuration Hierarchy

1. **Built-in defaults** (hardcoded sensible defaults)
2. **User config** (`~/.slb/config.toml`)

### Default Dangerous Patterns

Organized by domain:

**File System**:
- `rm -rf`, `rm -r` (with path analysis)
- `chmod -R`, `chown -R` on sensitive paths
- Operations on `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/boot`

**Git**:
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `git push --force` (but not `--force-with-lease`)
- `git rebase` on main/master

**Kubernetes**:
- `kubectl delete node|namespace|pv|pvc`
- `kubectl delete` anything in `kube-system`
- `helm uninstall --all`

**Databases**:
- `DROP DATABASE/SCHEMA/TABLE`
- `TRUNCATE TABLE`
- `DELETE FROM` without `WHERE`

**Cloud**:
- `terraform destroy` (without -target)
- `aws * terminate-instances`
- `gcloud * delete --quiet`

**Containers**:
- `docker system prune -a`
- `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)`

## Integration Patterns

### Claude Code Hooks

Generate a `.claude/hooks.json` that intercepts dangerous commands:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre_bash": {
      "command": "slb patterns test --exit-code",
      "input": {
        "command": "${COMMAND}"
      },
      "on_block": {
        "message": "This command requires slb approval. Use: slb request \"${COMMAND}\" --reason \"...\" --expected-effect \"...\" --goal \"...\" --safety \"...\""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `--exit-code` flag makes `slb patterns test` return non-zero if approval is needed, triggering the hook's `on_block`.

Generate with:
```bash
slb integrations claude-hooks --install
```

### Cursor Rules

Generate `.cursorrules` section:

```markdown
## Dangerous Command Policy

Before running any command matching these patterns, you MUST use slb:

1. Check if command needs approval: `slb patterns test "<command>"`
2. If approval needed: `slb request "<command>" --reason "..." --expected-effect "..." --goal "..." --safety "..."`
3. Wait for approval: `slb status <request-id>`
4. Execute when approved: `slb execute <request-id>`

Never run dangerous commands directly.
```

### Agent Mail Integration

When a request is created, slb sends a notification via Agent Mail:

```go
// internal/integrations/agentmail.go
func (am *AgentMailClient) NotifyNewRequest(req *db.Request) error {
    importance := "normal"
    if req.RiskTier == db.RiskCritical {
        importance = "urgent"
    }

    return am.SendMessage(agentmail.Message{
        ProjectKey: req.ProjectPath,
        SenderName: "SLB-System",
        To:         []string{"SLB-Broadcast"}, // Virtual broadcast
        Subject:    fmt.Sprintf("[SLB] %s: %s", strings.ToUpper(string(req.RiskTier)), truncate(req.Command, 50)),
        BodyMD: fmt.Sprintf(`## Command Approval Request

**ID**: %s
**Risk**: %s
**Command**: ` + "`%s`" + `

### Justification
%s

### Expected Effect
%s

---
To review: ` + "`slb review %s`" + `
To approve: ` + "`slb approve %s --session-id <your-session>`",
            req.ID, req.RiskTier, req.Command,
            req.Justification.Reason, req.Justification.ExpectedEffect,
            req.ID, req.ID),
        Importance: importance,
        ThreadID:   "SLB-Reviews",
    })
}
```

---

## Agent Workflow

### For Requesting Agent

```bash
# 1. Start session (once per agent lifetime)
SESSION_JSON=$(slb session start \
  --agent "GreenLake" \
  --program "claude-code" \
  --model "opus-4.5" \
  --json)

SESSION_ID=$(echo "$SESSION_JSON" | jq -r '.session_id')

# 2. Use slb run for dangerous commands — it handles everything automatically
# (checks pattern, creates request if needed, waits, executes if approved)
RESULT=$(slb run "rm -rf ./build" \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --reason "Removing stale build artifacts" \
  --timeout 300 \
  --json)

STATUS=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.status')
if [ "$STATUS" = "executed" ]; then
  echo "Build directory cleaned"
elif [ "$STATUS" = "rejected" ]; then
  echo "Request rejected: $(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.reject_reason')"
  # Reconsider approach...
else
  echo "Request timed out, escalating to human..."
fi

# --- Alternative: Manual plumbing workflow (for advanced use cases) ---
# PATTERN_CHECK=$(slb patterns test "rm -rf ./build" --json)
# NEEDS_APPROVAL=$(echo "$PATTERN_CHECK" | jq -r '.needs_approval')
#
# if [ "$NEEDS_APPROVAL" = "true" ]; then
#   REQUEST_JSON=$(slb request "rm -rf ./build" \
#     --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
#     --reason "Removing stale build artifacts" \
#     --wait --execute --timeout 300 --json)
#
#   REQUEST_ID=$(echo "$REQUEST_JSON" | jq -r '.request_id')
#   # ... handle result
# fi

# 6. End session when done
slb session end --session-id "$SESSION_ID"
```

### For Reviewing Agent

```bash
# Option 1: Watch mode (blocks and prompts for each request)
slb watch --session-id "$SESSION_ID"

# Option 2: Poll and review (useful in scripts)
PENDING=$(slb pending --json)

echo "$PENDING" | jq -c '.[]' | while read -r request; do
  REQUEST_ID=$(echo "$request" | jq -r '.id')

  # Get full details
  DETAILS=$(slb review "$REQUEST_ID" --json)

  # Evaluate the request (in practice, an AI agent reads and reasons about this)
  COMMAND=$(echo "$DETAILS" | jq -r '.command')
  REASON=$(echo "$DETAILS" | jq -r '.justification.reason')

  # Example: approve if it's a build directory cleanup
  if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -q "./build"; then
    slb approve "$REQUEST_ID" \
      --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
      --reason-response "Valid cleanup operation" \
      --effect-response "Confirmed build dir is ephemeral" \
      --goal-response "Aligns with disk space management" \
      --safety-response "Verified no source code in path"
  else
    slb reject "$REQUEST_ID" \
      --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
      --reason "This path may contain source code, not just build artifacts"
  fi
done
```

## Security Considerations

### What slb IS

- **Peer review system**: Second opinion on destructive actions
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of what was proposed, approved, executed
- **Friction mechanism**: Forces deliberation before destruction
- **Learning tool**: Patterns can be refined based on outcomes

### What slb IS NOT

- **Cryptographic security**: Session keys are for identification, not authentication
- **Tamper-proof**: A malicious agent could bypass slb entirely
- **Access control**: Doesn't prevent command execution, just adds a step

### Trust Model

1. **Agents are trusted but fallible**: They follow instructions but make mistakes
2. **Honor system**: Agents are instructed to use slb, but can't be forced
3. **Defense in depth**: slb is one layer; combine with file permissions, RBAC, etc.
4. **Audit over prevention**: Focus on knowing what happened, not preventing everything

### Signature Verification

Review signatures include timestamps and are validated as follows:
- Signature = HMAC-SHA256(session_key, request_id || decision || timestamp)
- Timestamp must be within 5 minutes of current time (prevents replay)
- Request ID binding prevents approval from being applied to different request
- Session key binding ensures only the registered session can sign

### Sensitive Data Handling

Commands may contain sensitive data (API keys, passwords, connection strings).
slb provides options to handle this:

```bash
# Redact sensitive portions in logs/display (still executes full command)
slb request 'mysql -p$DB_PASS -e "DROP TABLE users"' \
  --redact '\$\w+' \              # Redacts env var references
  --redact 'password=\S+'         # Redacts password params
```

Redaction applies to:
- TUI display
- History browser
- Git audit commits
- Agent Mail notifications

The **actual command** stored in the database is unredacted for execution,
but marked with `contains_sensitive = true` flag. Access to raw commands
requires explicit `--show-sensitive` flag.

**Default redaction patterns** (always applied):
- `-p<password>`, `--password=<value>`
- `Bearer <token>`, `Authorization: <value>`
- Environment variable expansions (`$VAR`, `${VAR}`)

### Recommendations

1. **Always gitignore .slb/**: Prevent accidental commits of pending requests
2. **Use separate git history repo**: Keep audit trail separate from project
3. **Review history periodically**: Look for patterns of concern
4. **Set tight timeouts for CRITICAL**: Don't let dangerous requests linger
5. **Enable desktop notifications**: Human should know about CRITICAL requests

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1: No Other Agents Available

**Scenario**: Single agent working alone, needs dangerous command.

**Solution**: This is by design. slb requires multiple agents for peer review. If you're working solo:
1. Request times out → escalates to human (desktop notification)
2. Human uses `slb tui` to approve/reject
3. Or human uses `slb emergency-execute` with full logging

**No self-approval**: The whole point is peer review. If you're alone, get a human.

### Edge Case 2: Agent Approves Own Request

**Prevention**: Explicit check that `requestor_session_id != reviewer_session_id`

**Special case**: If configured `trusted_self_approve` and agent is trusted, allow after delay.

### Edge Case 3: Conflicting Reviews

**Scenario**: Agent A approves, Agent B rejects the same request.

**Resolution options** (configurable):
1. First response wins (speed priority)
2. Any rejection blocks (safety priority)
3. Majority vote with minimum threshold
4. Human breaks tie

**Default**: Any rejection blocks. Safety over speed.

### Edge Case 4: Stale Sessions

**Scenario**: Agent crashes without ending session.

**Solutions**:
1. Session heartbeat requirement (every 5 min)
2. Auto-expire sessions after inactivity (30 min)
3. `slb session gc` to clean up stale sessions

### Edge Case 5: Large Dry Run Output

**Scenario**: `kubectl delete` on 1000 pods produces huge output.

**Solutions**:
1. Truncate with "... and N more lines"
2. Store full output in file, show summary in request
3. Configurable max dry run output size

### Edge Case 6: Request During Daemon Downtime

**Scenario**: Request file created but daemon not running.

**Solutions**:
1. Daemon startup scans pending/ for stale requests
2. Recalculate timeouts from creation time
3. Warn if requests found that are past expiry

**Graceful degradation** (when daemon is unavailable):

Commands check daemon status before requiring it:
```bash
# slb request checks for daemon
$ slb request "rm -rf ./build" ...
Warning: slb daemon not running. Request created but notifications disabled.
Reviewers must manually check: slb pending
Start daemon with: slb daemon start

# Request still works, just without:
# - Desktop notifications
# - Real-time TUI updates
# - Agent Mail integration
# - Fast IPC (falls back to file polling)
```

This allows slb to function in degraded mode rather than failing completely.

### Edge Case 7: Filesystem Permissions

**Scenario**: Agent can't write to .slb/pending.

**Solutions**:
1. `slb init` creates directory with appropriate permissions
2. Clear error message: "Cannot write to .slb/, check permissions"
3. Fallback to user-level pending queue

### Edge Case 8: Request Flooding

**Scenario**: Agent gets stuck in loop, submits hundreds of requests.

**Prevention**:
1. Per-session rate limits (default: 10/min, 5 concurrent pending)
2. When exceeded: immediate rejection with clear error
3. Alert in TUI dashboard: "Session X hitting rate limits"
4. Historical tracking for pattern detection

**Recovery**:
```bash
slb session reset-limits --session-id <id>  # Human can reset if legitimate
```

### Edge Case 9: No Different-Model Reviewer Available

**Scenario**: Configuration requires `require_different_model = true` for a request,
but no agent using a different model is active.

**Solutions**:
1. Configurable timeout before escalation (`different_model_timeout = 300`)
2. After timeout: escalate to human with clear message:
   ```
   "Request req-xyz requires different-model review (requestor: opus-4.5),
    but no active sessions with a different model. Escalating to human."
   ```
3. TUI shows the constraint in request details:
   ```
   ⚠️ Requires different model (requestor: opus-4.5)
   Available reviewers: GreenLake (opus-4.5) ❌ same model
   ```
4. Consider auto-suggest: "Try launching a reviewer agent with claude-sonnet?"

**Prevention**:
- Document model diversity in agent deployment
- Consider requiring 2+ models when `require_different_model = true` is set
- `slb session list --json` shows model distribution for planning

## AGENTS.md Blurb

Add this section to AGENTS.md:

```markdown
## slb — Simultaneous Launch Button (Dangerous Command Authorization)

**slb** implements a two-person rule for destructive commands. Before running commands that match dangerous patterns, you MUST get approval from another agent.

### Why This Exists

When multiple agents work in parallel, one agent's mistake can destroy another's work or critical infrastructure. A second opinion catches errors before they become irreversible.

### Forgotten How to Use slb?

Just run `slb` with no arguments - it prints a quickstart guide.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start your session (do this once when you begin)
SESSION=$(slb session start --agent "<YourAgentName>" --program "claude-code" --model "opus-4.5" --json)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$SESSION" | jq -r '.session_id')

# 2. Check if a command needs approval
slb patterns test "rm -rf ./build" --json
# {"needs_approval": true, "tier": "dangerous", "min_approvals": 1}

# 3. Request approval for dangerous commands
REQUEST=$(slb request "rm -rf ./build" \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --reason "Removing stale build artifacts" \
  --expected-effect "Deletes ./build directory" \
  --goal "Free up disk space before rebuild" \
  --safety "Build dir is regenerated, no source code affected" \
  --json)
REQUEST_ID=$(echo "$REQUEST" | jq -r '.request_id')

# 4. Wait for approval (blocks until approved/rejected/timeout)
slb status "$REQUEST_ID" --wait --json

# 5. Execute when approved
slb execute "$REQUEST_ID" --json

# 6. End session when done
slb session end --session-id "$SESSION_ID"
```

### As a Reviewer

Check for pending requests periodically:
```bash
slb pending --json
slb review <request-id> --json
slb approve <request-id> --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --reason-response "Verified safe"
# OR
slb reject <request-id> --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --reason "Path contains source code"
```

Or run in watch mode (will prompt for each pending request):
```bash
slb watch --session-id "$SESSION_ID"
```

### Risk Tiers

| Tier | Requires | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| CRITICAL | 2+ approvals | `DROP DATABASE`, `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete node` |
| DANGEROUS | 1 approval | `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `kubectl delete deployment` |
| CAUTION | Auto-approved (30s) | `rm *.log`, `git stash drop` |

### All Commands Support --json

Every slb command outputs structured JSON with `--json`. Parse with jq:
```bash
slb pending --json | jq '.[] | select(.risk_tier == "critical")'
```

### What to Include in Requests

1. **Reason**: Why do you need to run this command?
2. **Expected Effect**: What will actually happen?
3. **Goal**: What are you trying to achieve?
4. **Safety Argument**: Why is this safe or reversible?

Be specific. "Cleaning up" is not enough. "Removing ./build directory (500MB of compiled artifacts) to fix out-of-space error before next build" is good.

### What to Check When Reviewing

1. Does the reason make sense?
2. Is the expected effect accurate?
3. Does this align with AGENTS.md rules?
4. Is there a safer alternative?
5. Has the dry-run output been reviewed?

When in doubt, reject and ask for clarification.

### Adding New Dangerous Patterns

If you encounter a command that SHOULD require approval but doesn't, ADD IT:

```bash
slb patterns add --tier dangerous "^helm upgrade.*--force" \
  --reason "Force upgrades can cause downtime"
```

You can freely ADD patterns (making things safer). You CANNOT remove patterns - that requires human approval via `slb patterns request-removal`.

### Never Bypass slb

Do NOT run dangerous commands directly. Even if you're confident. The point is peer review, not just approval.

Human operators can use `slb tui` for a visual dashboard, or `slb emergency-execute` for urgent overrides with full logging.
```

## Future Enhancements

### v1.1: Learning Mode

- Track which commands get approved vs rejected
- Track which executed commands caused subsequent problems
- Generate pattern recommendations based on history
- Anomaly detection: "This agent has unusually high rejection rate"

### v1.2: Team Features

- Named reviewer groups ("infra-team", "senior-devs")
- Escalation chains: Agent → Senior Agent → Human
- Scheduled approval windows (no CRITICAL approvals after 6pm)

### v1.3: Cloud Sync

- Optional cloud backup of history
- Cross-machine session management
- Team dashboard (web UI)

### v1.4: ML-Assisted Review

- Suggest approval/rejection based on historical patterns
- Highlight unusual aspects of requests
- Auto-generate review responses

---

## Open Questions (Resolved)

1. **Single vs multiple binaries**: Should daemon be separate binary or `slb daemon start` spawns subprocess?

   *Decision*: Single binary with `slb daemon start` forking a background process.

   **Implementation**:
   ```go
   // slb daemon start
   if os.Getenv("SLB_DAEMON_MODE") != "1" {
       // Fork ourselves with daemon flag
       cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], "daemon", "start")
       cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(), "SLB_DAEMON_MODE=1")
       cmd.Start()
       cmd.Process.Release() // Detach
       fmt.Println("Daemon started, PID:", cmd.Process.Pid)
       return
   }
   // Actually run daemon logic
   runDaemon()
   ```

   **PID file**: `/tmp/slb-daemon-{user}.pid`
   **Socket**: `/tmp/slb-{user}.sock`
   **Logs**: `~/.slb/daemon.log`

2. **Windows support priority**: How important is Windows support initially?

   *Decision*: Linux/macOS first, Windows later (file watching differs significantly).

3. **Multi-project awareness**: Should a single daemon handle multiple projects?

   *Decision*: Yes, one user-level daemon monitoring all projects with .slb/ directories.

4. **Rate limiting**: Should there be limits on request frequency?

   *Decision*: Yes, implement per-session rate limits (10/min, 5 concurrent pending) to prevent
   malfunctioning agents from flooding the review queue. See `[rate_limits]` config section.

5. **Client-side vs daemon-side execution**: Where should commands actually execute?

   *Decision*: Client-side execution. The daemon is a **notary** (verifies approvals and signatures),
   not an executor. Commands must run in the **calling process's shell environment** to inherit:
   - AWS_PROFILE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - KUBECONFIG pointing to the right cluster
   - Activated virtualenvs (VIRTUAL_ENV, modified PATH)
   - SSH_AUTH_SOCK for SSH agent forwarding
   - Database connection strings in env vars
   - Shell aliases or functions

## Appendix: Pattern Matching Details

### Pattern Syntax

Patterns use regex with these conventions:
- Case-insensitive by default
- `^` anchors to command start
- `\s+` for whitespace
- `(?!...)` for negative lookahead
- `.*` for any characters

### Command Normalization (Before Pattern Matching)

To reduce false negatives/positives, slb normalizes commands before applying tier patterns:

1. **Parse** with a shell-aware tokenizer (POSIX-like quoting rules)
2. **Extract the primary command** from common wrappers:
   - `sudo`, `doas`
   - `env VAR=...`
   - `command`, `builtin`
   - `time`, `nice`, `ionice`, `nohup`
3. **Detect compound commands** (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, subshells):
   - If any segment matches a tier, the whole request is treated as at least that tier
   - If parsing fails, fall back to raw-regex and **upgrade** tier by one step as a conservative default
4. **Normalize whitespace** and produce a canonical "display form" for the reviewer

This keeps config patterns simple (they can still look like `^rm\s+-rf`) while making them work in real terminals.

**Examples of normalization:**
- `sudo rm -rf ./build` → primary command: `rm -rf ./build`
- `env KUBECONFIG=/path kubectl delete pod` → primary command: `kubectl delete pod`
- `cd /etc && rm -rf *` → compound, both segments checked, `/etc` as CWD for second

### Pattern Precedence

When a command matches multiple patterns:
1. Check SAFE patterns first → skip entirely
2. Check CRITICAL → highest risk wins
3. Check DANGEROUS
4. Check CAUTION
5. No match → allowed without review

### Path-Aware Patterns

Patterns run against the **Resolved Command** with paths expanded:

1. `slb` detects CWD at request time
2. Expands relative paths (`./`, `../`) to absolute paths
3. Matches patterns against the fully resolved string

```toml
# More dangerous if path is outside project
[patterns.critical.context]
pattern = "^rm\\s+-rf"
require_path_check = true
# Checks against the RESOLVED absolute path, regardless of how command was typed
dangerous_prefixes = ["/", "/etc", "/var", "/usr", "/home"]
safe_prefixes = ["${PROJECT_ROOT}/tmp", "${PROJECT_ROOT}/build"]
```

### SQL Pattern Considerations

SQL commands are notoriously hard to pattern-match because:
- They can span multiple lines
- Comments (`--`, `/* */`) can appear anywhere
- Table names can be quoted (`"table"`, `` `table` ``, `[table]`)
- CTEs can precede DELETE (`WITH x AS (...) DELETE FROM...`)

The built-in SQL patterns are best-effort. For production databases:
1. Use database-level permissions as primary control
2. Consider adding custom patterns for your specific ORM/query style
3. Enable `require_sql_explain = true` in config for EXPLAIN output attachment

## Installation & Distribution

### One-Line Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/cmd/slb@latest
```

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/slb
```

### Shell Completions

After installing, add to your shell rc file:

```bash
# zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(slb completion zsh)"

# bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(slb completion bash)"

# fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
slb completion fish | source
```

Shell completions provide:
- Tab completions for all commands and flags
- Request ID completion from pending list
- Session ID completion from active sessions

---

## NTM Integration

slb integrates naturally with NTM for multi-agent orchestration:

```bash
# In your NTM session, agents use slb for dangerous commands
ntm send myproject --cc "Use slb to request approval before any rm -rf or kubectl delete commands"

# slb watch can run in a dedicated pane
ntm add myproject --cc=1  # Dedicated reviewer agent
ntm send myproject:cc_added_1 "Run 'slb watch' and review all pending requests carefully"
```

**Command palette integration**: Add to your NTM config.toml:

```toml
[[palette]]
key = "slb_pending"
label = "SLB: Review Pending"
category = "Safety"
prompt = "Check slb pending and review any dangerous command requests"

[[palette]]
key = "slb_status"
label = "SLB: Check Status"
category = "Safety"
prompt = "Run 'slb pending --json' to see all pending approvals and 'slb sessions --json' to see active agents"
```
