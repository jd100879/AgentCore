I need implementation plans for 1 beads. For EACH bead, provide a plan following this exact format:

{
  "id": "bd-XXXX",
  "code": "pXa-01",
  "title": "Short action-oriented title",
  "priority": "P0|P1|P2|P3",
  "depends_on": ["bd-YYYY"],

  "how_to_think": "One focused paragraph explaining the intent of this bead, what must be preserved (idempotency, transaction boundaries, additive changes), and when to stop/escalate. CRITICAL: This helps pool-based agents understand the mindset needed - are they debugging? refactoring? exploring? building new features?",

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Clear measurable outcome",
    "Another measurable outcome"
  ],

  "files_to_create": ["path/to/new-file.ts"],
  "files_to_modify": ["path/to/existing-file.ts"],

  "verification": [
    "Docker-first or concrete command to run",
    "What must be true afterward (expected output, state, test results)"
  ]
}

Return as valid JSON array where each element corresponds to a bead in order:

[
  {
    "id": "bd-test-001",
    "code": "...",
    "title": "...",
    ...
  },
  // ... one object per bead
]


## Bead 1: bd-test-001
**Title:** Failed to load
**Status:** unknown
**Description:**
Error loading bead info

**Dependencies:** none


Return ONLY the JSON array, no commentary.
