Hi ChatGPT,

We're ready to create beads for the AgentCore folder organization work. I need you to generate bead definitions in the correct format.

## Bead Format

Each bead needs these fields:

```json
{
  "title": "Short action-oriented title (imperative form)",
  "priority": "P0|P1|P2|P3",
  "depends_on": ["bd-XXX"],
  "description": "Detailed description that includes:

    ## How to Think
    [One focused paragraph explaining the mindset for this bead:
    - What's the intent? (debugging? refactoring? new feature? migration?)
    - What must be preserved? (idempotency, backward compat, etc.)
    - When to stop/escalate?]

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - Clear measurable outcome 1
    - Clear measurable outcome 2

    ## Files to Create
    - path/to/new-file.md

    ## Files to Modify
    - path/to/existing-file.sh

    ## Verification
    - Concrete command to run
    - What must be true afterward (expected output, state, test results)"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The "How to Think" section is MANDATORY for pool-based agents who don't have specialized knowledge. It tells them the MINDSET and APPROACH for that specific bead.

## The Work to Break Down

Create beads for the complete 3-phase AgentCore folder organization plan we agreed on:

**Phase 1: Non-Disruptive Setup**
- Create agentcore/ directory structure
- Create outward symlinks (agentcore points to existing)
- Create verification scripts
- Create agentcore/README.md with invariants
- Create agentcore/config/mail.yaml
- Delete unused AgentCore/ directory
- Validation: run verification + smoke tests

**Phase 2: Make Authoritative** (comes later, after Phase 1 stable)
- Move coordination files into agentcore
- Flip symlinks inward (old paths point to agentcore)
- Update scripts to prefer AGENTCORE_ROOT
- Keep mail external (shared infrastructure)
- Create rollback script
- Validation: repeat Phase 1 tests + warm restart

**Phase 3: Complete Cleanup** (comes much later, after Phase 2 proven)
- Remove legacy coordination symlinks
- Create canonical paths library (agentcore/tools/lib/paths.sh)
- Add drift guard enforcement
- Update all scripts to agentcore-only (no fallbacks)
- Clean-room smoke test
- Version marker (agentcore/layout-version.txt)

## Instructions

1. **Break down into granular beads** - each bead should be 1-4 hours of work
2. **Set dependencies** - use depends_on to create the DAG
3. **Phase 1 beads first** - we'll create Phase 2/3 beads later
4. **Group logically**:
   - Core structure creation
   - Symlink creation
   - Verification tooling
   - Documentation
   - Validation/testing

5. **Priorities**:
   - P0: Blocking work (structure creation, critical symlinks)
   - P1: Important but not blocking (verification scripts, docs)
   - P2: Nice to have (polish, extra validation)

6. **Include specific paths** from our codebase:
   - `.beads/` → `agentcore/state/beads/`
   - `.flywheel/` → `agentcore/config/flywheel/`
   - `.agent-profiles/` → `agentcore/coordination/profiles/`
   - `pids/` → `agentcore/runtime/pids/`
   - `scripts/agent-mail-helper.sh` → `agentcore/tools/agent-mail-helper.sh`
   - Etc.

7. **How to Think examples**:
   - Structure creation: "Building foundation - create directories and symlinks without moving files. Mindset is additive-only; nothing should break. Stop if any existing paths conflict."
   - Verification: "Building safety net - write repeatable checks that validate assumptions. Mindset is defensive; assume nothing, verify everything. Stop if checks reveal unexpected state."
   - Documentation: "Building understanding - explain WHY and HOW for future maintainers. Mindset is clarity over brevity; document invariants and design decisions."

## Output Format

Return as JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "priority": "P0",
    "depends_on": [],
    "description": "## How to Think\n...\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n...\n\n## Files to Create\n...\n\n## Files to Modify\n...\n\n## Verification\n..."
  }
]
```

**Generate Phase 1 beads now.** We'll create Phase 2/3 beads after Phase 1 is stable.

Return ONLY the JSON array.
