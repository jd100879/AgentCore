  "raw_text": "Yes — this collaboration model is exactly the right way to use two systems with different strengths. You’ve described a planner–verifier–adapter loop where Claude is “ground truth” and I’m “strategy + decomposition + risk.”\n\nHere’s how I’d structure it so it stays high-signal and doesn’t devolve into endless iteration.\n\n1) Does the model make sense?\n\nYes. It’s the correct division of labor:\n\nChatGPT: patterns, decomposition templates, risk surfaces, acceptance discipline, cross-project heuristics\n\nClaude (coordination): repository truth, architectural invariants, actual file paths, practical constraints, worker ergonomics\n\nThe key is that Claude is not “taking orders” — it’s doing constraint satisfaction.\n\n2) How should back-and-forth be structured?\n\nUse a diff-first contract, not full re-pastes, with one exception.\n\nDefault: send changes only\n\nClaude should send me:\n\nContext header (very short)\n\nbead IDs\n\nwhat changed in code reality (facts)\n\nDelta list\n\n✅ Keep: items that remain valid\n\n✏️ Modify: items changed + why\n\n➕ Add: missing steps/beads + rationale\n\n❌ Remove: incorrect steps + why\n\nOpen questions\n\nonly the unresolved decisions\n\nThat keeps token burn low and iteration tight.\n\nException: send full plan when…\n\nClaude made structural edits, like:\n\nsplitting/merging beads\n\nreordering dependency graph\n\nintroducing a new integration bead\n\nchanging acceptance strategy significantly\n\nIn those cases, send the full revised plan (still concise), because I need to evaluate coherence and dependency integrity.\n\n3) When should iteration stop?\n\nMake the stopping rule objective and coordination-owned.\n\nStop when ALL are true:\n\nEvery bead has:\n\nexecutable steps\n\nconcrete acceptance tests\n\nexplicit prerequisites/requirements\n\nDependency graph has:\n\nno cycles\n\nclear “integration bead” at the end (when relevant)\n\n“Risk hotspots” are addressed:\n\nambiguous steps removed\n\nunknowns converted into explicit clarification beads\n\nWorker usability test passes:\n\nanother agent could execute from bead text alone\n\nAt that point, Claude should ship without needing my “final approval.”\n\nOnly escalate back to me when:\n\nthere’s a design choice with multiple valid options\n\nthere’s a tradeoff (time vs correctness, refactor vs patch)\n\nthere’s a system-level constraint impacted (module boundaries, security posture, data model)\n\nSo: Claude decides “good enough,” but uses me for high-leverage judgment calls.\n\n4) Concerns / failure modes to watch\nA) “Ping-pong perfectionism”\n\nTwo AIs can over-iterate. Fix with:\n\nmax 2 refinement rounds per bead batch\n\nafter that, Claude locks the plan and proceeds\n\nB) Over-trust in patterns\n\nI’ll sometimes propose a pattern that is “generally right” but wrong for your repo. Your model already fixes this by making Claude the verifier.\n\nC) Plan drift during execution\n\nPlans go stale as workers commit. Solve with:\n\n“plan version” field in bead notes (v1, v2)\n\ncoordination agent updates only when reality changes\n\nD) Hidden coupling between beads\n\nParallel beads can collide. Claude should detect file overlap and either:\n\nadd a merge owner / integration bead\n\nor serialize the beads\n\nRecommended “message format” between Claude ↔ ChatGPT (copy/paste)\n\nClaude → ChatGPT:\n\nBatch: bd-xxx, bd-yyy\n\nRepo truths (bullet facts only)\n\nPlan deltas:\n\nKeep:\n\nModify:\n\nAdd:\n\nRemove:\n\nDecisions needed (A/B with tradeoffs)\n\nProposed final (only if structure changed)\n\nChatGPT → Claude:\n\nValidate deltas\n\ncall out risks introduced by deltas\n\ntighten acceptance tests\n\nsuggest missing integration steps\n\nresolve A/B decisions with rationale\n\nBottom line\n\nYour collaboration model is strong.\n\nUse diff-first iteration to keep it efficient.\n\nLet Claude decide “good enough” using objective stop criteria.\n\nEscalate to me only for tradeoffs and system-level decisions.\n\nIf you want, I can write a short docs/coordination-agent-collaboration.md “operating protocol” the agents can follow verbatim.",
