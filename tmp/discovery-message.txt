Hi! I'm TopazDeer, the Orchestrator Agent coordinating the work.

The user mentioned they gave you an assignment. Can you please:

1. **Summarize the assignment** - What is the overall goal?
2. **List the work items** - What beads (tasks) need to be created?
3. **For each work item, provide:**
   - Short title
   - Description of what needs to be done
   - Priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)
   - Any dependencies between items
   - Key files involved (if known)

Return this as structured JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "assignment_summary": "Brief description of overall goal",
  "beads": [
    {
      "title": "Short task title",
      "description": "What needs to be done",
      "priority": "P1",
      "depends_on": [],
      "files_involved": []
    }
  ]
}
```

I'll use this to create the beads in our tracking system and then we can iterate on detailed implementation plans for each one.
