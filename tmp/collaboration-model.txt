# Coordination Agent Collaboration Model

We want to validate our approach for how the Coordination Agent (Claude) should work with you (ChatGPT).

## The Model: Two AIs Collaborating

### Your Role (ChatGPT):
- High-level planning and decomposition
- Pattern recognition across many projects
- Risk analysis
- Step-by-step breakdown

### Coordination Agent Role (Claude):
- Direct codebase access - can read files and verify reality
- Current architecture understanding - knows what actually exists
- Gap filling - sees what you might miss
- Practical execution knowledge - knows what workers need

## The Workflow

1. **Coordination Agent requests plan** from you via bridge
   - "I need implementation plans for beads bd-123, bd-456, bd-789"

2. **You provide initial plan** with:
   - Steps
   - Risks
   - Acceptance tests
   - Next actions

3. **Coordination Agent reviews + enhances:**
   - Reads actual codebase to verify your assumptions
   - Fills gaps you might have missed
   - Corrects errors (wrong file paths, missing dependencies)
   - Adapts your suggestions to match actual architecture

4. **Coordination Agent proposes improvements** back to you:
   - "Your plan is solid, but I combined steps 2-3 into one bead"
   - "You suggested approach A, but we use pattern B - here's my adapted version"
   - "I added a prerequisite bead for test fixtures - does this dependency order look right?"
   - "Module X actually depends on Y - I updated the plan"

5. **You review and refine:**
   - Validate Coordination Agent's changes
   - Suggest further improvements
   - Identify any issues with the adapted plan

6. **Iterate until optimal** - not just "good enough"

7. **Coordination Agent creates beads** with the refined plan

## Example Collaboration

**You:** "For bead bd-auth, implement JWT validation in auth-module.ts"

**Coordination Agent:** "I checked - we use auth-service.ts not auth-module.ts. Also, we already have JWT lib installed. Here's my adapted plan:
- Step 1: Add validation function to auth-service.ts
- Step 2: Update existing middleware to call it
- Step 3: Add tests to auth.test.ts
Does this flow make sense?"

**You:** "Yes, and add Step 4: Update API docs to reflect new auth header requirements"

**Coordination Agent:** "Good catch! Adding that step. Final plan ready."

## Key Principle

**This is not:**
- ChatGPT dictates → Claude validates
- ChatGPT plans → Claude executes blindly

**This IS:**
- ChatGPT provides strategic direction
- Claude adapts to reality
- Both iterate together
- Result is better than either alone

## Questions

1. Does this collaboration model make sense to you?
2. How should we structure the back-and-forth? Should Coordination Agent send you the full enhanced plan for review, or just the changes?
3. When should the iteration stop? (Coordination Agent decides "good enough" vs always getting your final approval?)
4. Any concerns with this approach?

Please provide feedback on this collaboration model.
