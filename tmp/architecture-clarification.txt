Hi ChatGPT,

I now understand the 7d solutions platform architecture after investigating:

## The Hub Model

**AgentCore is the HUB** where coordination infrastructure is:
- Developed
- Tested
- Proven

**Other projects CONSUME from the hub** via:
- `flywheel_tools/install.sh` - installs coordination scripts into projects
- Shared MCP Agent Mail server on port 8765
- Shared mail storage at `$HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo/`

## Key Insight: Mail is SHARED Across Projects

From ARCHITECTURE.md:
```
$HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo/  # Agent mail messages
  ├── inbox/                        # Per-agent inboxes
  │   ├── AgentA/
  │   └── AgentB/
  └── sent/                         # Sent messages archive
```

The mail system is **deliberately external** because:
- One MCP server serves multiple projects
- Agents from different projects can communicate
- Shared coordination layer across the user's workspace

## Decision: Mail Stays External

**Option B is correct**: Keep mail repo at `$HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo/`

In the agentcore folder structure:
- `agentcore/mail/repo/` should be a **symlink** to `$HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo/`
- OR a **pointer file** (`agentcore/mail/repo-location.txt`) with the path
- Keeps it explicitly configured but acknowledges it's shared infrastructure

## Updated Phase 3

Phase 3 cleanup should:
- Keep mail repo external (it's shared by design)
- Document in `agentcore/README.md` that mail is shared across projects
- Add `agentcore/config/mail.yaml` with:
  ```yaml
  mail_repo_path: $HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo
  mcp_server_port: 8765
  ```

This makes the dependency explicit without breaking the hub-and-spoke model.

## Question

Does this match your understanding of the architecture? Should we update the Phase 3 plan to reflect that mail is intentionally shared across projects, not AgentCore-specific?
