Hi ChatGPT,

Before we tackle the agent mail system, we need to organize the folder structure first.

I've attached a complete snapshot of the current codebase structure below. Please review it and propose:

## What I Need:

1. **Canonical `/agentcore` directory structure** (lowercase) that:
   - Centralizes agent coordination infrastructure
   - Has clear, deterministic layout
   - Avoids drift and ambiguity
   - Supports the mail system we'll build afterward

2. **For each directory, specify**:
   - Purpose and what it contains
   - Naming conventions
   - Which existing files/directories should move there
   - What's new vs reorganized

3. **Migration considerations**:
   - What happens to existing `.agent-*` directories?
   - Should they be symlinks, moved, or deprecated?
   - What about the empty `AgentCore/` directory (capital A)?
   - How do we transition without breaking running agents?

4. **Principles to follow**:
   - "Verify-first" mindset (don't assume, check actual state)
   - Minimize disruption to running systems
   - Clear boundaries between components
   - Support future mail system (inbox/outbox/processing/done/failed flows)

## Current Codebase Structure:

```
--- (see tmp/codebase-snapshot.md for full details) ---
```

**Key points**:
- Component directories: mcp_agent_mail/, beads_rust/, flywheel_tools/, ntm/, etc.
- Hidden agent dirs: .agent-*, .beads/, .flywheel/
- Scripts scattered in scripts/ and symlinked to flywheel_tools/
- Mail storage currently in $HOME/.mcp_agent_mail_local_repo/ (external)
- Empty AgentCore/ directory exists (legacy?)

Return your proposal as structured JSON:

```json
{
  "agentcore_structure": {
    "directory_tree": "visual representation of /agentcore structure",
    "directories": [
      {
        "path": "agentcore/mail",
        "purpose": "...",
        "contents": ["inbox/", "outbox/", "..."],
        "migration": {
          "from": ["existing paths to move/link"],
          "strategy": "move|symlink|create_new",
          "backwards_compat": "how to maintain compatibility"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "migration_plan": {
    "phase_1": "...",
    "phase_2": "...",
    "rollback_strategy": "..."
  },
  "questions_for_orchestrator": [
    "Specific questions about actual codebase state"
  ]
}
```

Focus on the folder structure ONLY - we'll tackle the mail system implementation in the next iteration.
