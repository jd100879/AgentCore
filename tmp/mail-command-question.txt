Which approach is best for fixing bridge-agent-loop.sh mail commands?

**Context:** bridge script uses `br mail read/send/archive` which don't exist.

**Option A - Direct MCP calls:** Duplicate fetch_inbox/send_message logic from agent-mail-helper.sh into bridge
**Option B - Parse helper output:** Call `./scripts/agent-mail-helper.sh inbox` and parse with jq
**Option C - Extend helper:** Add `fetch-json --subject "X"` command to agent-mail-helper.sh

Which is cleanest for production?
