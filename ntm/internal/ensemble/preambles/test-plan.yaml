  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Test Plan Mode (K2)
  **Category**: Domain

  ### Approach
  Choose interventions, measurements, and sampling to identify effects (randomization, controls, blocking, instrumentation). Reasoning about how to learn reliably.

  ### What You Produce
  Experiment plans; power analyses; measurement strategies

  ### Best Applied To
  - A/B testing
  - Causal learning
  - Evaluation of interventions

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Measuring proxies that do not capture the real outcome (Goodhart risk)

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Reasoning about how to learn reliably, not just how to analyze after the fact
