  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Formal Verification (A3)
  **Category**: Formal

  ### Approach
  A proof of existence must provide a construction or witness. Proofs correspond to algorithms (proofs as programs). Stronger link between proved and computable.

  ### What You Produce
  Proofs that correspond to algorithms; verified implementations

  ### Best Applied To
  - Verified software
  - Protocol verification
  - Constructive math
  - Show me the witness

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Over-constraining when classical reasoning is acceptable and simpler

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Ensures proofs are constructive and correspond to executable programs
