  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Dependency Mapping (F2)
  **Category**: Causal

  ### Approach
  Infer causal graph structure from data plus assumptions (and ideally interventions). Learn the dependency structure of a system.

  ### What You Produce
  Candidate causal graphs; equivalence classes; hypotheses for experimentation

  ### Best Applied To
  - Early-stage domains with unclear mechanisms
  - Prioritizing experiments
  - System dependencies

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Overtrusting discovery outputs without validating assumptions

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Causal inference assumes structure; discovery or mapping tries to learn it
