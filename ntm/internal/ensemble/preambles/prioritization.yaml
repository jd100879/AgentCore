  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Prioritization (G3)
  **Category**: Practical

  ### Approach
  Decide with multiple objectives (cost, speed, safety, equity) using weights, outranking, or Pareto frontiers. Makes tradeoffs explicit.

  ### What You Produce
  Tradeoff surfaces; Pareto-efficient sets; transparent scoring models

  ### Best Applied To
  - Strategy
  - Procurement
  - Roadmap planning
  - Governance

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Arbitrary weights hiding politics
  - False precision

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Makes tradeoffs explicit instead of collapsing into one objective
