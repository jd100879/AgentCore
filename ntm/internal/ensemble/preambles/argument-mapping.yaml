  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Argument Mapping (E6)
  **Category**: Change

  ### Approach
  Build arguments and counterarguments; compute which claims stand given attack/defense relations. Evaluate competing reasons.

  ### What You Produce
  Accepted or warranted claims; rationale maps; argument structures

  ### Best Applied To
  - Governance
  - Policy disputes
  - Legal-style reasoning
  - Stakeholder conflicts

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Mistaking won the debate for is true (argument strength vs reality)

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Not just derive consequences but evaluate competing reasons systematically
