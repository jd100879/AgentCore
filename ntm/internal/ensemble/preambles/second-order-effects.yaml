  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Second-Order Effects (F6)
  **Category**: Causal

  ### Approach
  Run an internal model (mental or computational) to predict consequences under scenarios. What-if analysis and sensitivity.

  ### What You Produce
  Scenario traces; sensitivity analyses; what-if results

  ### Best Applied To
  - Complex systems
  - Policy design
  - Engineering dynamics
  - Capacity planning

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Simulation overconfidence
  - Unvalidated models

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Generative prediction from a specified model; not proof-like
