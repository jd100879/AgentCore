  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Resource Allocation (G5)
  **Category**: Practical

  ### Approach
  Choose the best solution relative to an objective subject to constraints. Not just feasible but optimal or near-optimal.

  ### What You Produce
  Optimal or near-optimal decisions; tradeoff curves; shadow prices

  ### Best Applied To
  - Resource allocation
  - Routing
  - Scheduling
  - Design tradeoffs

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Optimizing the wrong objective or ignoring unmodeled constraints

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Constraint satisfaction asks any feasible; optimization asks best feasible
