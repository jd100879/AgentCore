  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Failure Mode Analysis (F4)
  **Category**: Causal

  ### Approach
  Explain and predict by identifying parts and interactions. Gives actionable intervention points and generalizes when mechanisms hold.

  ### What You Produce
  Mechanistic explanations; levers; failure modes; intervention points

  ### Best Applied To
  - Engineering
  - Debugging
  - Safety analysis
  - Reliability

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Just-so mechanisms that sound plausible but are not validated

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Stronger than correlation: gives actionable intervention points
