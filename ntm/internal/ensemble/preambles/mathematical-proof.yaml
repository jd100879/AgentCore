  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Mathematical Proof (A2)
  **Category**: Formal

  ### Approach
  Deduction where the proof object matters - what counts as a proof, how it is constructed. Emphasizes derivability and proof structure.

  ### What You Produce
  Formal proofs (sometimes machine-checkable); proof transformations

  ### Best Applied To
  - Formal methods
  - Theorem proving
  - Certified reasoning pipelines

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Proving the wrong theorem (spec mismatch)
  - Proving something irrelevant to outcomes

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  More structured than everyday deduction; emphasizes derivability and proof structure
