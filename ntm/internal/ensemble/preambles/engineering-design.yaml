  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Engineering Design Reasoning (K3)
  **Category**: Domain

  ### Approach
  Iterate from requirements to architectures to prototypes with tradeoffs, constraints, and failure analyses. Multi-objective and constraint-laden.

  ### What You Produce
  Designs; specs; tradeoff justifications; test plans

  ### Best Applied To
  - Product development
  - Reliability
  - Architecture decisions

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Premature optimization or over-engineering
  - Ignoring maintainability

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Inherently multi-objective and constraint-laden; relies on simulation and safety margins
