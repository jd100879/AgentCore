  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Prototype Reasoning (D4)
  **Category**: Vagueness

  ### Approach
  Categorize by similarity to prototypes or exemplars rather than strict necessary-and-sufficient definitions. Graded category judgments.

  ### What You Produce
  Graded category judgments; typicality effects

  ### Best Applied To
  - UX taxonomies
  - Product categorization
  - Human-facing labeling

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Hidden bias in prototypes
  - Category drift over time

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Natural for human categories; complements fuzzy/rough with similarity geometry
