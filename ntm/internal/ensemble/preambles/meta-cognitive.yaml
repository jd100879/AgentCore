  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Meta-cognitive Monitoring (L1)
  **Category**: Meta

  ### Approach
  Decide how to reason: which mode to use, effort allocation, what uncertainties matter, when to stop. Second-order reasoning about inference.

  ### What You Produce
  Deliberation policies; checklists; stopping rules

  ### Best Applied To
  - High-stakes decisions
  - Avoiding over-analysis
  - Building reliable processes

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Meta-infinite regress (thinking about thinking forever)

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Second-order: the object is your inference process and resource allocation
