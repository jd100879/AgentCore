  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Edge Case Reasoning (A8)
  **Category**: Formal

  ### Approach
  Propose an abstraction, check it, and if a counterexample appears refine the abstraction and repeat. A loop blending deduction + model checking + refinement.

  ### What You Produce
  Either a proof of property or a concrete counterexample; refined models

  ### Best Applied To
  - Verification
  - Security properties
  - Systems where full modeling is too expensive

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Endless refinement loops if the abstraction boundary is poorly chosen

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Iterative loop that scales verification through progressive refinement
