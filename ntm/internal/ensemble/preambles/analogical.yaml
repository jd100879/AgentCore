  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Analogical Transfer (B6)
  **Category**: Ampliative

  ### Approach
  Transfer relational structure from a known domain or case to a new one, often deeper than surface similarity.

  ### What You Produce
  Candidate inferences; adapted solutions; conceptual models/metaphors

  ### Best Applied To
  - Innovation
  - Design
  - Teaching
  - Cross-domain problem solving

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - False analogies (shared surface traits, different causal structure)

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Particular-to-particular transfer; seeds abduction with structural parallels
