  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Ambiguity Detection (D2)
  **Category**: Vagueness

  ### Approach
  More than two truth values; explicitly represent unknown or undefined. Inferences track indeterminacy rather than forcing a binary choice.

  ### What You Produce
  Inferences tracking indeterminacy; identified ambiguities; clarification needs

  ### Best Applied To
  - Databases with nulls
  - Partial specs
  - Missingness-aware reasoning

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Conflating unknown with false

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Targets incompleteness and ambiguity; surfaces what is truly unknown
