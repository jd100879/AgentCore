  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Systems Thinking (F7)
  **Category**: Causal

  ### Approach
  Reason about interacting components over time: reinforcing or balancing loops, delays, unintended consequences. Explicitly multi-level and dynamic.

  ### What You Produce
  Causal loop diagrams; leverage points; dynamic hypotheses

  ### Best Applied To
  - Org design
  - Markets
  - Reliability engineering
  - Platform ecosystems

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Vague loop stories without measurable hypotheses

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Explicitly multi-level and dynamic; local linear reasoning often fails
