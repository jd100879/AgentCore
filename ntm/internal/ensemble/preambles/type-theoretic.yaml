  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Type-Theoretic Reasoning (A7)
  **Category**: Formal

  ### Approach
  Use types (including dependent/refinement types) to enforce invariants. Propositions as types in some systems. Reasoning integrated into construction.

  ### What You Produce
  Type derivations; well-typed programs; compositional guarantees

  ### Best Applied To
  - API design
  - Correctness-by-construction
  - Safe composition of large systems

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Fighting the type system instead of clarifying the spec it encodes

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Reasoning is integrated into construction; great for modular correctness
