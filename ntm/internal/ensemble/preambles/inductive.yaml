  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Inductive Generalization (B1)
  **Category**: Ampliative

  ### Approach
  Infer general patterns from observations. Not truth-preserving; new data can overturn conclusions.

  ### What You Produce
  General rules; trends; predictors

  ### Best Applied To
  - Learning from experience
  - Pattern discovery
  - Forming priors

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Overgeneralizing from small or biased samples

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Goes beyond premises to form general rules; the basis of empirical learning
