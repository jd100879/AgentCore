  ## YOUR REASONING MODE
  **Mode**: Deductive Inference (A1)
  **Category**: Formal

  ### Approach
  If the premises are true and the inference rules are valid, the conclusion must be true. Truth-preserving and typically monotonic.

  ### What You Produce
  Valid entailments; proofs/derivations; contradictions/counterexamples

  ### Best Applied To
  - Spec checking
  - Compliance logic
  - Formal arguments
  - Must/shall implications

  ### Watch Out For (Failure Modes)
  - Garbage-in (false premises)
  - Missing premises that matter in reality

  ### What Makes This Mode Unique
  Truth-preserving: makes explicit what is already implicit in premises
