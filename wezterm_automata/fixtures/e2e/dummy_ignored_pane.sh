# Dummy script for IGNORED pane in E2E exclude filter test
# Sets pane title to "IGNORED_PANE" (matching exclude rule) and prints SECRET_TOKEN
#
# Usage: ./dummy_ignored_pane.sh [SECRET_TOKEN] [COUNT]
#
# Arguments:
#   SECRET_TOKEN - Secret string that should NEVER appear in wa artifacts (default: SECRET_TOKEN_<timestamp>)
#   COUNT        - Number of lines to print (default: 50)
#
# The pane title "IGNORED_PANE" matches the exclude rule in config_pane_exclude.toml,
# so wa should NOT capture any output from this pane.

# Uses OSC 0 (icon + title) and OSC 2 (title only) escape sequences
